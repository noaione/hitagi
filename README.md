A "modern" Vue 3 client for LANraragi

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- LANraragi Instances (v0.9.0+)

## Deploy

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to create a production build with SSR.
3. Run `node .output/server/index.mjs` to run the server.

### Replacing built-in web UI

Sadly, you can't. Since the Web UI is tied to whatever templating engine and some path aren't even possible (mostly admin related stuff).
